## Event Booking App - Server Side

*Please note that you will need to install and start the code in the client as well for the application to work*

First update the value of MONGODB_URI in the `.env.locale` file in order for your database to be created(you'll then need to change the file to `.env`).

Install the local dependencies using either `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Finally, you can start the app using either `npm start` or `yarn start`(the server should start on port 8000).
